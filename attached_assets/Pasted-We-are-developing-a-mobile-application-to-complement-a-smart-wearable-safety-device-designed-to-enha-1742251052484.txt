We are developing a mobile application to complement a smart wearable safety device designed to enhance womenâ€™s safety and provide emergency response. The app should serve as the central interface for configuring, monitoring, and controlling the wearable device. Below are the key features the app must include:

1. User Profile and Configuration
User registration and secure login.
Option to configure personal details, emergency contacts, and medical history.
Profile customization for setting stress thresholds and response preferences.
2. Real-Time Tracking and Monitoring
Display real-time location of the wearable device using GPS.
Live tracking on a map interface with the option to share location with emergency contacts.
Continuous monitoring of physiological data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance).
Notifications if stress indicators exceed the defined threshold.
3. Multi-Level Emergency Alert System
Level 1: Automatic alert based on physiological stress detection.

Sends notifications to emergency contacts with location and threat level.
Level 2: Manual activation of an alert using a dedicated button on the app.

Allows the user to notify contacts or authorities immediately.
Level 3: Activation of the electric shock mechanism.

Automatically sends high-priority alerts with real-time location and threat details to emergency services and emergency contacts.
4. Electric Shock Control and Safety Mechanisms
Option to enable or disable the electric shock feature.
Safety settings to prevent accidental shocks.
Confirmation prompt before manual activation.
5. Communication and Connectivity
Bluetooth and GPS integration for seamless data transmission.
Offline mode to store data locally when connectivity is lost.
Notification if connectivity with the wearable device is lost.
6. User Interface and Experience
Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Minimalistic design with quick-access buttons for emergency activation.
Dark mode and customizable themes.
7. Data Logging and Reporting
Logs of past alerts, GPS locations, and physiological data.
Option to export data to share with authorities or healthcare providers.
8. Battery and Device Status Monitoring
Real-time battery level monitoring.
Notifications for low battery and connectivity issues.
Option to put the device in low-power mode to extend battery life.
9. Security and Privacy
End-to-end encryption of all data.
Secure authentication using biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).
Option to delete personal data from the app at any time.
10. Additional Features
Vibration Alerts: To notify the user of incoming messages or high-stress detection.
Voice Activation: Option to trigger alerts using voice commands.
Geofencing: Notifications when the user enters or exits a defined safe zone.
Development Considerations
The app should be available for both Android and iOS platforms.
Ensure minimal battery consumption and fast performance.
Use scalable architecture to handle future feature upgrades.
This app should provide a seamless and reliable safety solution, working in sync with the wearable device to enhance user security and emergency response.
